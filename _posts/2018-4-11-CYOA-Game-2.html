<p>
  It was hard to keep track of all the different paths in my game, but I orginized them with the names of the files.
  I am proud of the dificulty leval of my game. It is not impossibe to win, but its not too easy.
  I could make the ending paths better. The endings are very abrupt and I feel like I could fix that.
  This is my game. If you win, please click the link at the end of my game to continue on to Travon's game. <a href= 'https://TornMutedGraph--LukeBrown2.repl.co'>
